        ArchItUp is creative platform for new architects and students of
        architecture that want to introduce themselves to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        Itâ€™s a place where they can show their projects, write and read
        interesting articles, discuss architecture, share knowledge with others,
        find out about workshops and lectures they can attend or test their
        skills on different competitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Main focus is to help new architects to present themselves, gain
        confidence and teach them how to sell themselves.
